        <p class="small-text" class="ramps-items">RAMPS is an organization that provides exceptional opportunities to give back to the Bryan community. Through
            this group I have been able to help construct 4 different ramps. Each one has improve the lives of a family by
            granting a person with disabilities access to their home where they would previously require assistance entering.
            This organization has also worked with groups such as The Big Event and Habitat for Humanity, which have allowed
            me to
            provide services such as building houses and landscaping yards.
