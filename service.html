        <p class="small-text" class="ramps-items">RAMPS is an organization that provides exceptional opportunities to give back to the Bryan community. Through
            this group I have been able to help construct 4 different ramps. Each one has improve the lives of a family by
            granting a person with disabilities access to their home where they would previously require assistance entering.
            This organization has also worked with groups such as The Big Event and Habitat for Humanity, which have allowed
            me to provide services such as building houses and landscaping <br><br>

        <p class="small-text" class="scouts-items"> My Eagle Scout project was an excellent opportunity for me to take initiative and lead a team
            towards a common goal. I was able to work directly with the board of a church to propose a plan for the project,
            recruit volunteers, lay out a plan and schedule for the project, and direct the activites of these volunteers on
            the days of the project. This experience was invaluable because it showed me all the expectations of being a leader
            and the role's importance to the outcome of the project. <br><br>
